1.    HTML, Bootstrap and CSS
2.    Flask Templates
3.    Flask WTForms
4.    Flask SQLAlchemy
5.    Flask Login

--------------------------------

1. A landing page that clearly conveys what kind of events the website promotes, as well as some upcoming events. Also, your landing page must allow users to browse the events by category (you are free to support this functionality using a drop-down menu or some other intuitive way). In addition, you might include a text-based search functionality. However, this is an advanced feature and is optional to those who would like to include it (it is not specified in the CRA but the more intuitive your search is the better).

--------------------------------

2. The events listed on the landing page should show a useful overview of the events with information in accordance with the context of the design (including event status). 

--------------------------------

3. Anybody should be able to choose an event and view the details of it. The event details page should have an image of the event, a description of the event, the date, and any other specific information that is helpful to the user and is in accordance with the context of the design and requirements.

--------------------------------

4.To buy tickets, the user should be logged in. The user should provide details such as the quantity of the tickets to be booked. An order is generated by the application, and the order detail (order id) is provided to the user for reference.
a)
If the user buys tickets equal to the tickets available, the event should be labeled ‘Booked out’
b)
If the user enters a number of tickets that exceeds the tickets available, the application should inform the user that the order cannot be placed.

--------------------------------

5. A logged-in user can post a comment (a review) of an event. The name of the commenter, the review, and the date the review was posted can be seen by anybody.

--------------------------------

6. A logged-in user can create an event by entering relevant details. In addition, an event must have one of the following states: Upcoming, Inactive, Booked, or Cancelled. The owner of the event should be able to update the details of the event (including the status). They can also delete their own events.

--------------------------------

9. Error Handling:
a)
You must gracefully handle instances of “page is not found” and “internal server errors” by providing a useful message and allowing users to easily navigate back to the landing/home page.
b)
A user should be authenticated (via login) to perform tasks on this site.
c)
User input validation – empty strings, incorrect input for specific fields, etc. should be correctly managed. Use the post-redirect-get pattern when posting forms.

10. All your pages should include a navigation menu and should utilise data that is dynamically created and stored in the database solution.
